# Finding-Odd-Radio-Circle

This project aims to explore object detection method to find Odd Radio Circule using radio astromony images.

The following method was used:

- Preprocesing: radio astronomy image preprocessing using method demonstrate by Galvin et.el (https://github.com/tjgalvin/pyink/blob/master/pyink/preprocessing.py)

- Object detection method 1 - Circle Hough Transform

- Object detection method 2 - Blod Detector

- Object detection method 3 - Blod Detector using PyBDSF
